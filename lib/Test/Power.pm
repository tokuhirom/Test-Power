=head1 NAME

Test::Power - With great power, comes great responsibility.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Power;

    sub foo { 4 }
    ok { foo() == 3 };
    ok { foo() == 4 };

Output:

    not ok 1 - L12 : ok { foo() == 3 };
    #   Failed test 'L12 : ok { foo() == 3 };'
    #   at foo.pl line 12.
    # foo()
    #    => 4
    ok 2 - L13 : ok { foo() == 4 };
    1..2
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 2.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNINGS: This module is currently on ALPHA state. Any APIs will change without notice. Notice that since this module uses the B power, it may cause segmentation fault.>

Test::Power is yet another testing framework.

Test::Power shows progress data if it fails. For example, here is a testing script using Test::Power. This test may fail.

    use Test::Power;

    sub foo { 3 }
    ok { foo() == 2 };
    done_testing;

Output is:

    not ok 1 - L6: ok { foo() == 2 };
    # foo()
    #    => 3
    1..1

Woooooooh! It's pretty magical. C<Test::Power> shows the calculation progress! You don't need to use different functions for different testing types, like ok, cmp_ok, is...

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< ok(&code) >>

    ok { $foo };

This simply runs the C<&code>, and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or failed.
A true expression passes, a false one fails.  Very simple.

=item C<< subtest() >>

Same as C<Test::More::subtest>.

=item C<< plan() >>

Same as C<Test::More::plan>.

=item C<< done_testing() >>

Same as C<Test::More::done_testing>.

=item C<< pass() >>

Same as C<Test::More::pass>.
